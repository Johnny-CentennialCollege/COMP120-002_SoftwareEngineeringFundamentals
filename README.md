# GROUP-PROJECT_COMP120-002_SoftwareEngineeringFundamentals

This repository was created for the agile group project assigned by Prof. Viji at Centennial College in the fall semester 2020. 

**Group members** are: 

| Full Name | Student Number |
|-----------|----------------|
| Sepideh Akbari |           |
| Gelareh Arbab-Arbabi |     |
| Zhiyang Song |  301167073  |

Due to time difference and being unable to use audio over social media tools like Discord, Telegram or WhatsApp, which is likely to be blocked by some Chinese Internet censorship mechanisms, Sepideh Akbari proposed separation that Zhiyang Song should do this project on his own Nov.26, and this project has to be terminated.
